# DevOps Hack 2017 - Guidance
This content is used for an instructor led lab and initially deliverd during the [2017 DevOps Hackathon Roadshow](http://aka.ms/msdevopshack) provided my Microsoft and Orangenetworks.

The idea is that you get a hands-on experience on the Microsoft tooling around DevOps (mostly VSTS and Azure). Almost every single challenge can be done no matter which Operating System you are running. You'll be working with a browser mostly and sometimes you might be using Git.

Be warned: This will be hard - you will actually be *doing* stuff!

You can find a bunch of challenges in [this][1] document.

This is how it works:
1. Go read the [challenges document][1].
1. Tackle the challenges one by one.
1. If you need help check the hints documents linked in the challenges docs. You will find a bunch of screenshots there which will guide you.
1. If you need more help ask an instructor.

Hint:
The documents containing hints are not step-by-step guides as you might expect. We want you to explore and get to know the tools so they provide just a rough guidance.  

So now, get started and good luck with all the challenges!
