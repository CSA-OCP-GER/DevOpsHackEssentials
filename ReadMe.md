# DevOps Hack 2017 - Guidance
This content is intended to be used for an instructor led lab, and will be delivered during the [2017 DevOps Hackathon Roadshow](http://aka.ms/msdevopshack) provided by Microsoft and Orange Networks.

The intent is to provide a hands-on experience with Microsoft's DevOps tooling (mostly VSTS and Azure). Most challenges are operating system agnostic, and will be performed with a browser or Git.

Be warned: The format is not a step by step recipie - you will be required to think!

You can find a bunch of challenges in [this][1] document.

This is how it works:
1. Go read the [challenges document][1].
1. Tackle the challenges one by one.
1. If you need help, check the hints documents linked in the challenges docs. You will find screenshots and information there to guide you.
1. If you need more help ask an instructor.

Note:
The documents containing hints are not step-by-step guides as you might expect. We want you to explore and get to know the tools, so they provide what we hope is just enough guidance.
If you need more assistance, please ask an instructor.  

So now, get started and good luck with [all the challenges!][1]
