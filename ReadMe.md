# DevOps Hack (preview)
This content is used for an instructor led lab. You can find a bunch of challenges in [this][1] document.

This is how it works:
1. Go read the [challenges document][1].
1. Tackle the challenges one by one.
1. If you need help check the hints documents linked in the challenges docs. You will find a bunch of screenshots there which will guide you.
1. If you need more help ask an instructor.

Hint:
The documents containing hints are not step-by-step guides as you might expect. We want you to explore and get to know the tools so they provide just a rough guidance.
